# Expert-Data-Visualisation-v7

This is https://github.com/josdirksen/d3dv updated for v7 of D3.  This is for the book https://www.packtpub.com/product/expert-data-visualization/9781786463494 .  I am making personal stylistic changes including using arrow functions whenever possible, using my own organizational conventions, and removing all uses of lodash.

I'll format this readme.md later.
